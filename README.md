### Hi there I'm Mrinal ðŸ‘‹

Simply put, I got roped into computer science by watching the social network a few too many time and am really enjoying what I'm learning. <br> <br>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in: 3rd year <br>
ðŸŒ± I am interested in: software development, AI/ML, and learning more! <br>
ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out, I am always up for a chat :) <br>
ðŸ“« How to reach me: mrinal_goshalia@sfu.ca <br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I once named my Wi-Fi network "404 Network Not Found" to prank my neighbors. <br>
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her <br>
<br>
Take a look at my projects!
